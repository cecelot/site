These are some headings:

# h1

## h2

### h3

#### h4

##### h5

###### h6

I can also do [links](https://example.com), and `inline code`.

```js
console.log("and code blocks too!");
```

Here's an equation: $$E = mc^2$$

And here's a more complex equation:

$$
\begin{align}
\int_0^1 e^x dx &= (e^x)\vert_0^1\\
&= e^1 - e^0\\
&= e - 1
\end{align}
$$

This is what an image looks like:
