If you're seeing this website now, everything should be working again.

# Why

I was overhauling this website behind the scenes. I added the [collections page](/collections). I also moved the blog and notes indexes to [/in/[slug]](/in/notes) pages. I did this because there was a lot of unnecessary code duplication between [/blog](/blog) and [/notes](/notes).

The major problems arise because I decided that I needed to make sure old links don't break, and I wanted to use Astro's [redirect functionality](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/routing/#configured-redirects) to do it. While it _did_ technically work, it caused all sorts of issues, mainly because I had to switch to the `server` output for Astro, which is the [SSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side_scripting#Server-side_rendering) version.

This is the list of the issues I made last night:

- **Fix individual tag pages**: `/tags/[tag]` pages were erroring on the client (it was `cannot read properties of undefined`)[^1], causing a white screen. I did not see this at all in development and it disappeared when I switched back to Astro's `static` output.
- **Fix pages not being prerendered**: Mainly an issue with the [gallery](/gallery). It is expensive to fetch every object from R2 during build (takes ~14 seconds), and with the `server` output, this was happening essentially every time a user navigates to the gallery. I have it [memoized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization) during build, so I only have to do it once there, but it relies on a non-serverless runtime to work.
- **Fix redirects**: I made a couple typos that I simply didn't catch until I was on the plane, and I didn't really want to fix it then. I did have free Wi-Fi during the flight, though.

# Solution

I decided to not use Astro's redirect functionality, and so switched everything back to static rendering. My commit history is a mess, but now all the redirecting happens through Cloudflare's [bulk redirects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/url-forwarding/bulk-redirects/) feature[^2], and everything works!

[^1]: Thank you, Vercel logs!

[^2]: It's called bulk, but I don't have redirects for every individual post/note. It looks like this: `/p/[slug]` $$\implies$$ `/node/[slug]`.
