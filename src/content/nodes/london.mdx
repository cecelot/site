Between mid-May and mid-June, I had the incredible opportunity to study abroad in London to fulfill the Humanities & Arts requirement at my university. In total, I completed three courses in the abbreviated five-week term. HU 3900, the capstone, was the most involved, where we (students, individually) research a topic of our choice in the hopes of better understanding it.

Since a main benefit of this program was the ability to use local resources[^1], I decided to take a deep dive into the influences in British computers during and immediately following WW2. I had watched [The Imitation Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Imitation_Game) and had heard Alan Turing described as the "father of modern computing,"[^2] so his work during World War II was where I began my search. He played a major role throughout the story I uncovered, but his role was not the most significant. Lest I repeat too much of my argument, I invite you to [check out my final capstone paper](https://c.sydneyn.dev/hua-capstone-paper.pdf) to see everything I discovered.

Beyond my academic work, I was able to experience large swaths of the (quite extensive) London metro, visiting places like the Churchill War Rooms, Buckingham Palace[^3], Greenwich, the West End[^4], the Palace of Westminster, Shakespeare's Globe[^5], Kew Gardens, and the Tower of London (and those are just the highlights). A **small selection** of photos from my time in London are [in my gallery](/gallery). (I have over 300 from Kew Gardens alone.)

I really loved London, particularly when it came to transit. I took the Tube or the regional rail everywhere, and it was remarkably pleasant (except for the brutal heat some days). And of the three largest cities I've been in (London, Paris, NYC), London is by far my favorite, to the point that I could even see myself living there in the future.

I'm lucky enough to have two more opportunities to study abroad before I graduate, and I hope to take advantage of both.

[^3]: specifically for the Changing of the Guard, which I firmly believe is *not* worth seeing in person

[^4]: I saw The Comedy About Spies and it was incredible

[^5]: Romeo and Juliet was excellent
