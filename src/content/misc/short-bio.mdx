I'm a rising sophomore majoring in computer science. My primary academic interests are in systems design (e.g., of [programming languages](/node/writing-a-compiler)), [distributed computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing), and [numerical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis).

When I'm not in class, you can usually find me working on my latest side
project, reading a book, playing [Magic](https://magic.wizards.com) with
friends, or in the outdoors doing anything from skiing to hiking to kayaking.
