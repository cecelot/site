I've wanted to publish a self-hosted online photo gallery for a while now, but I could never decide what to use. From server solutions with way more functionality than I needed to minimal premade static galleries like [Sigal](http://sigal.saimon.org/en/latest/) or [the "Gallery" Hugo theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-gallery/), there are a plethora of options out there.

They all fell _just a little short_: either in terms of functionality, UI, or a mix of both. After experimenting a bit with Sigal and briefly considering a couple other options, I decided to scrap the idea of using something that already existed and just build my own.

# CSS Grid: Now

I had seen swipeable image galleries online many, many times, but I didn't really want to write something that involved, and I figured any online JavaScript library I found would be too clunky to use and/or look out of place here[^1]. A simple grid would suffice for me.

**At least, I _thought_ it was simple.**

But no! I spent far, far too long yesterday trying to figure out how design something that had "a fixed number of columns and variable height rows." I tried many different search queries to figure out the magical CSS invocations I needed to write, including "row with dynamic height css grid" and "css mosaic grid," to _almost_ no avail.

The latter query, though, led me to [this wonderful post from Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/native-css-masonry-layout-css-grid/), and following their steps, I was able to achieve exactly what I wanted with just a few Tailwind classes:

```tsx
<div class="grid [grid-template-columns:repeat(auto-fill, minmax(160px,1fr))] [grid-template-rows:masonry]">
  {/* [items] */}
</div>
```

# CSS Grid: Future

Unfortunately, `grid-template-rows: masonry` is part of an [in-progress initiative](https://webkit.org/blog/15269/help-us-invent-masonry-layouts-for-css-grid-level-3/) led by [WebKit](https://webkit.org) to make "CSS Grid Level 3" a reality, so this doesn't actually exist in most browsers yet. There's also some debate over how to implement the feature, but I really do hope it comes to fruition. They describe all the motivation for why this should exist in their blog post, so I won't reiterate it here.

I will comment, though, that I think it is a natural thing to say, "I don't actually want a row axis, just give me a certain number of columns," as shown by (1) I really thought this was possible with the version of CSS Grid available now; and (2) there are _so many_ examples of this layout on the web (so it doesn't seem to just be me).

There are some alternatives available now to achieve the same effect, like the [`masonry-layout`](https://masonry.desandro.com) JavaScript library, and maybe I will pursue that in the future, but I'm happy enough with how [my gallery](/gallery) looks right now, even with the feature disabled, that it's not a priority for me[^2].

## The Experiment

As of the time of publishing this post, [only Safari and Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout/Masonry_layout#browser_compatibility) support the masonry grid, and both as an experimental, opt-in feature. But this is how you can enable it, if you're using either of those browsers:

### In Safari

1. Go to Safari > Settings > Advanced
2. Ensure "Show features for web developers" is checked
3. Click on the "Feature Flags" tab
4. Type "masonry" in the search bar on the top right
5. Click the checkbox next to "CSS Masonry Layout"

It's also possible on iOS and iPadOS. The steps are almost identical, except via the Settings app rather than the browser itself.

### In Firefox

1. Type `about:config` into the address bar and press enter
2. Click "Accept the Risk and Continue"
3. Type "masonry" into the search bar at the top of the page
4. Double click on the "layout.css.grid-template-masonry-value.enabled" line

# Image Optimization

Once I had my nice masonry grid of photos, I decided to run [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev), which was when I discovered that loading half a dozen 3MB images isn't really that great: my Performance score on mobile dropped to ~40. Luckily, [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) offers [a feature to transform images](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/transform-images/) on a zone[^3], which works by setting up a `cdn-cgi` endpoint that looks like this:

```
/cdn-cgi/image/options/url
```

I used this to (1) dynamically convert my `jpeg` images to either `webp` or `avif` (depending on the browser); and (2) reduce the width and height for the thumbnail photos[^4], reducing my file sizes from several MB each to just a few KiB. These changes bumped my PageSpeed performance on mobile to ~80 (and it's nearly perfect for desktop). That's still not _amazing_, but it is much better than before.

# Conclusion

I've learned a few things in doing this, some of which seem obvious in retrospect:

- Don't serve big files, like, ever, unless the user explicitly wants the originals ([so much bandwidth will be saved](#bandwidth-statistics))
  - Don't serve 4 MB high-res photos for thumbnails (I really wasn't thinking for that one)
- It's important to run tools like PageSpeed Insights to catch design issues[^5]

I'm also really excited to finally have my very own photography portfolio/gallery.

Thanks for reading!
