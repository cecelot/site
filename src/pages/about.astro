      I'm a first-year student at <a target="_blank" href="https://wpi.edu"
        >Worcester Polytechnic Institute</a
      > majoring in Computer Science, with a particular interest in the
      <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/computational-biology"
        >intersection</a
      > between CS and biology.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alongside this, I have a distinct fascination with all things related to
      programming languages and operating systems, and I even <a
        href="/p/writing-a-compiler">wrote</a
      > a compiler of my own to further my understanding of how they work.

      My passion for techology excites me for the future and the societal
      advances we can make using new innovations and tools. I care deeply about
      responsible evolution of tech, so I'm cautiously optimistic about the role
      that artificial intelligence and machine learning will play in that
      future.
      <p>
        When I'm not taking classes, you can usually find me working on my
        latest side project, reading a book, playing <em>Magic</em> with friends,
        or in the outdoors doing anything from skiing to hiking to kayaking.
