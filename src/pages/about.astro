      I'm a first-year student at <a target="_blank" href="https://wpi.edu"
        >Worcester Polytechnic Institute</a
      > majoring in Computer Science, interested in developing sustainable software
      solutions for our digital future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alongside this, I have a fascination with all things related to
      programming languages and operating systems, and I even <a
        href="/p/writing-a-compiler">wrote a compiler</a
      > of my own to further my understanding of how they work.
    </p>
    <p>
      My passion for technology excites me for the future and the societal
      advances we can make using new innovations and tools. I care deeply about
      responsible evolution of tech, so I'm cautiously optimistic about the role
      that artificial intelligence and machine learning will play in that
      future.
      <p>
        When I'm not taking classes, you can usually find me working on my
        latest side project, reading a book, playing <a
          href="https://magic.wizards.com">Magic</a
        > with friends, or in the outdoors doing anything from skiing to hiking to
        kayaking.
