  I'm a first-year student at [Worcester Polytechnic
  Institute](https://www.wpi.edu) majoring in Computer Science, interested in
  developing sustainable software solutions for our digital future.
  <br />
  Alongside this, I have a fascination with all things related to programming
  languages and operating systems, and I even [wrote a
  compiler](/p/writing-a-compiler) of my own to further my understanding of how
  they work.
  <br />
  My passion for technology excites me for the future and the societal advances
  we can make using new innovations and tools. I care deeply about responsible
  evolution of tech, so I'm cautiously optimistic about the role that artificial
  intelligence and machine learning will play in that future.
  <br />
  When I'm not taking classes, you can usually find me working on my latest side
  project, reading a book, playing [Magic](https://magic.wizards.com) with
  friends, or in the outdoors doing anything from skiing to hiking to kayaking.
