  I'm a first-year student at [Worcester Polytechnic
  Institute](https://www.wpi.edu) majoring in Computer Science. I have a
  fascination with all things related to programming languages and even [wrote a
  small compiler](/node/writing-a-compiler) to learn more about how they work.
  <br />
  When I'm not taking classes, you can usually find me working on my latest side
  project, reading a book, playing [Magic](https://magic.wizards.com) with
  friends, or in the outdoors doing anything from skiing to hiking to kayaking.
